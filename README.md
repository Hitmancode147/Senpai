[![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/Dev-Yukine/Senpai-Bot-Discord/status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Dev-Yukine/Senpai-Bot-Discord)

if you want to host this bot yourself you need to install python 2.7 and a C compiler if you are on Windows you can run this command in a cmd line **npm install --global --production windows-build-tools** on some Linux distributions it is pre installed on some others not.

if you are on linux you need install FFMPEG yourself if you are on windows you mostly wont need since one of my dependencies handle that.

after that you should install the dependencies by run a **npm install** in the Bots directory.


also you need a **RethinkDB server**.
